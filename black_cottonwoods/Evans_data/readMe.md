# Phenology Phenotype Data from Evans et al. 2014

Specific methodological details can be found in the online version of Evans et al. 2014 doi:10.1038/ng.3075. Briefly, more than 1,000 P. trichocarpa genotypes were planted in 2009 in three replicated common gardens in Clatskanie OR, Corvallis OR, and Placerville CA in a randomized block design with three replicates of each genotype. In 2010, observations of spring bud flush, fall bud set, and total height in each garden were collected.
