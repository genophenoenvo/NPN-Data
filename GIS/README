Experimental

File:
DogWoodDaysofSoring_dump.gpkg.gz  3.5M

is a gziped GeoPackage? file

A set of layers exported from QGIS  then gzipped to reduce the 20M down to 3.5M
I expect you may need to `gunzip` it prior to using it.

the layers include  (2007 and later?)
	- all clones
	- all non clones
	- Prism plant hardiness zones
	- KR's anchor-clones
	- KR's sample-candidates within several km of the anchor-clones


File:
DogWoodDaysOfSpring.qgz   12K 

	The "QGIS" project file for this project on my machine. 
 	including just in case it is useful where but may be 
	too tightly coupled with my PostgreSQL/PostGIS instance
	(hence the 	geopackage)
